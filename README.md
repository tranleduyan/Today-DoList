# About:
It is a simple and useful to-do list application that allows you to add task and mark completed tasks! It is accessible to everyone, everywhere, from computers to phones, just at anywhere having an internet - it is for you! Manage your time, tasks, and remind your deadlines or even groceries with Today-Do List!

# Inspirations:
After participating in DubHack'22, I have been motivated a lot by many front-end designs and applications done by React. As I want to improve my skills on front-end development and get to learn React, I decided to create this mini application that can teach me a lot of things in React! In addition, this application can be applied and used to enhance my workflow, task management, and organizing plans. I put myself into everyone's shoes, each one of us is or was, perhaps, feeling stressed out of work loads, and we can only just think up finish a big chunk of work right away instead of breaking it down and have them done piece by piece. <br/>
I hope with this simple and easy to use interfaces, it can be reached out and loved by everyone!

# Languages and Tools:
HTML5, Tailwind CSS, React, JavaScript

# What I Learned:
- It should be React and JavaScript!
- I got a chance to learn creating responsive web application design, animating, and color choices
- I got to improve and gain a better understand for my web development skills
- "K-I-S-S", the simpler, the better application
# What Can It Be Improved:
- It can be improved by having a menu where users can create and name multiple topics/categories for their specific subject and add their tasks
- The task name can be edited
- Provide a progress bar showing the user's progress
- Having a place where users can add their goal of the day, update their status of a specific task
- Estimate how much time needed for each task or how much time needed in total
- Provide suggestions mode on which tasks can be done first to optimize the efficiency
