# About:
It is a simple and useful to-do list application that allows you to add task and mark completed tasks! It is accessible to everyone, everywhere, from computers to phones, just at anywhere having an internet - it is for you! Manage your time, tasks, and remind your deadlines or even groceries with Today-Do List!

# Inspirations:
As I want to improve my skills on front-end development and get to learn React, I decided to create this mini application that can teach me a lot of things in React! In addition, this application can be applied and used to enhance my workflow, task management, and organizing plans. I put myself into everyone's shoes, each one of us is or was, perhaps, feeling stressed out of work loads, and we can only just think up finish a big chunk of work right away instead of breaking it down and have them done piece by piece. <br/>
I hope with this simple and easy to use interfaces, it can be reached out and loved by everyone!
